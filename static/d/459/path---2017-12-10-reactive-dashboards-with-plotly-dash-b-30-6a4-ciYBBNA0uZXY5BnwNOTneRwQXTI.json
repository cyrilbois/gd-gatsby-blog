I wasn’t expecting that. It was pretty cool!</p>\n<p><img src=\"./tweet-chrisp.png\" alt=\"Chris Parmer&#x27;s Tweet\" title=\"Chris Parmer&#x27;s Tweet\"></p>\n<p>Dash is a pretty new framework in the Python ecosystem, but I think it will manage to get its own space among tools like Jupyter noteboooks and Bokeh interactive plots.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ucg8j\">Luke Singham</a> started <a href=\"https://github.com/Acrotrend/awesome-dash\">awesome-dash</a>, a curated list of awesome Dash resources. It contains links to tutorials, code snippets, example dashboards that will definitely be useful if you are just starting with Dash or want to learn a new thing or two. Don’t forget to start it on GitHub!</p>\n<p>Here are the slides of my talk:</p>\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 72.91666666666666%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"//slides.com/jackdbd/deck/embed\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          </div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reactive Dashboards with Plotly Dash","date":"December 10, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-12-10-reactive-dashboards-with-plotly-dash/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-10-31-how-to-get-started-with-regl-and-webpack/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to get started with regl and Webpack"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-12-31-interesting-things-other-people-did-in-2017/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interesting things other people did in 2017"}}}}
